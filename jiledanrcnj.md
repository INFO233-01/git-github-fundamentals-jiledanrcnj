I have learned the main difference between Git and GitHub. I have also gained knowledge about repositories, committing and pushing, pull requests, 
and branches. I learned that branches are utilized to experiment new ideas and features without merging it into the final project just yet. It is located
in a contained area of one's repository. I also learned that pull requests are essential when working with branches. This is because a pull request
tells other members of one's project about the changes one wants to make and ask for their feedback. 
I still need to learn more about cloning on GitHub. I know that cloning makes it easier to fix problems and add or remove files. It is a necessity for 
me to practice using the features of cloning on GitHub. I may need to experiment cloning a repository in a future project.
